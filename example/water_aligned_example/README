The full SALTED workflow can be run in two steps: run-aims.sbatch, which generates the training data, and run-ml.sbatch, which generates and validates a SALTER model.

The script run-aims.sbatch assumes an up-to-date version of AIMS is used (at least May 2024). The only modifications required should be to the SLURM commands, to match your HPC, and to specify the folder in which the qmdata will be stored: the location `QMDIR` in `run-aims.sbatch` must match `path2qm` in `inp.py`, and must exist (it won't be created automatically.

The SALTED commands in script run-ml.sbatch are available through the SALTER branch of the SALTED github. The only "unusual" dependency is psutil.

To specify the axis along which the field is applied for learning, the relevant cartesian coordinate should be selected for the `coefdir` and `projdir` in `inp.py`, and the corresponding descriptors should be calculated by passing the correct argument to the -d flag of `run-tensoap.py` in `run-ml.sbatch` - 1 = x, 2 = y, 3 = z.

The run-ml.sbatch also uses a modified version of the TENSOAP software, available from https://github.com/alanmlewis/TENSOAP. It should be installed by running `make` in the soapfast directory, and depends on Cython.
